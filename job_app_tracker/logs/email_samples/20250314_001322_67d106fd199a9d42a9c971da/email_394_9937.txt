 Trump's Economy Is Unpredictable—Are You Ready? 
 Donald Trump is back in the White House. 

 Some say it's a return to strong economic growth. 

 Others warn his presidency could bring unpredictable markets and new 
challenges.

 But here's the real issue: Nobody knows how the economy will react. 

 With the national debt soaring past $36 trillion and inflation continuing to 
eat away at retirement savings, the stakes couldn't be higher.

 Add in a stock market experts say is wildly overvalued, and the next few 
years could be the most uncertain we've seen in decades.

 The smartest move? Prepare now.
