Naeim -

Just checking in about tonight's Amazon training at 8PM EST.

We've had a lot of questions coming in already, which tells me
one thing:

People are ready for clarity, not just more information.

That's exactly what we're focusing on tonight - cutting through
the noise and showing you exactly what matters in building a real
Amazon business.
