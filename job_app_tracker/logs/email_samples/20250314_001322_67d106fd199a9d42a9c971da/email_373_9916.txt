** Looking the Part: Appearance Expectations
------------------------------------------------------------

We take pride in providing professional, high-quality service to our restaurant partners and their customers. A key part of that service is the way our drivers present themselves. Your appearance directly impacts a merchant’s brand reputation, and many of our partners expect a professional presentation from the drivers handling their orders.

Dressing appropriately helps build trust and ensures a positive experience for everyone involved. Merchants may provide feedback or even refuse service if a driver’s appearance doesn’t align with their standards.

Opt for polos, collared shirts, and clean pants or jeans, and avoid ripped clothing, open-toed shoes, or anything too casual. Small adjustments can make a big impact!
