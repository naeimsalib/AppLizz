Would you rather have bought Amazon shares for $5.33 in December
of 1999,

or $0.30 in September of 2001?

Both purchases would have seen tremendous growth — a $1000
investment in December, 1999 would be
worth $36,364 today*.

But, a $1000 purchase when Amazon pulled back in September 2001
would be worth $646,667*.

Sometimes it pays to wait for a pullback.

Our team of analysts at Motley Fool Stock Advisor have compiled
a list of 3 stocks whose prices tanked from recent market

P.S. Like one company that has seen a pullback from its all-time
high, all while recently expanding its gross profit 33% and
doubling its free cash flow margin from a year earlier.

Warren Buffett has said, “Be greedy when others are fearful.”

And right now is that time.

Pullbacks can make millionaires and billionaires — but only if
you do it smartly.
