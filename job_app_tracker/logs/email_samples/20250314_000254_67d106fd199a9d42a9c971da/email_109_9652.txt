The day was December 8th, 2017.

That was the  exact date I cashed out my 401k to launch my very first Passion Product (aka: a unique product) on Amazon:

Performance Nut Butter.

I was going ALLL in on Amazon FBA.

All the chips were moved to the center of the table.

No turning back.

This passion product was either gonna make me rich… or homeless…

No in the middle.

I had a bunch of people interested in the idea…

I got over 10,000 dollars funded from my Kickstarter…

So I didn’t have to use any of my money to buy inventory.

But there was just one big problem:

I had to pay $654.34 in Amazon fees…

But I didn’t have money.

Nothing.

My checking account literally read $0.

“Will I have to go and get a corporate job?"

“Will I have to work a 9-5 for the rest of my life”

That day, it felt like my mind was fighting against the universe.

But guess what? I kept fighting.

I pushed through the discomfort, paid these Amazon fees, and continued to launch my passion product on Amazon.

Then came the moment of truth - launch day.

The deciding factor of whether or not I’d be traveling to Thailand one month from now, or on the streets in LA.

I pressed “launch”...

And boom!

4 minutes later…

$569.23 in sales

40 minutes later…

$924.54 in sales

4 hours later…

$1,732.97 in sales

On my first day of launching my Passion Product on Amazon, I had made a total of $3,242.65 in sales.

I made more in one day than what I made in my 5 years of dropshipping before this.
