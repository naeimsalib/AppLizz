Got a DM the other day from a buddy of mine.

“Pat, I really want to start something… but I’m just waiting for the right time.”

Ah yes, the classic line.

I hear it ALL the time:

- I’ll start when I have more savings…
- I’ll start when I have more free time…
- I’ll start when I find the perfect idea…
But here’s the brutal truth:

There is no perfect time.

Every day, I see people launching businesses at record speed with AI.

Ideas that used to take months to build now take days (or even hours).

They aren’t waiting. 

They are building.

And that’s the biggest difference between people who make it and people who don’t.

They don’t sit around overthinking.

They just start.

If you’re serious about launching something, now is the time.

That’s exactly why we created the AI Build Accelerator.

To help people stop waiting and start building.

In two weeks, you’ll learn exactly how to go from idea → working product using AI (without needing to code).
 
Enrollment just opened, but spots are limited and I expect these to go fast.

(keeping the first group small for more hands on feedback & accountability).
