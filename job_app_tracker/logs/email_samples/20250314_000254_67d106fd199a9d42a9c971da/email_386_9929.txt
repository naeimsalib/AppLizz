 A First-of-Its-Kind Arctic Adventure 

 EXPEDITION ODYSSEY COMING TO SEAWORLD SPRING 2025!
Expedition Odyssey will be the world&rsquo;s first fully immersive Arctic experience. Guests will seamlessly transition from an exhilarating ride that virtually transports them through the Arctic&rsquo;s most spectacular landscapes, to a real-life encounter with some of the Arctic&rsquo;s most fascinating animals.


 At the heart of Expedition Odyssey is a revolutionary ride system that pushes the boundaries of theme park technology. Unlike traditional motion-based attractions, this next-generation vehicle delivers an unparalleled range of motion, allowing guests to soar, dive, twist and glide with the fluidity of ocean currents.


 The adventure begins as guests embark on a breathtaking tour of the Arctic. Guests will feel the rush of navigating powerful currents as they dodge towering icebergs, race alongside pods of beluga whale and dive deep into the hidden depths of the sea&mdash;all while experiencing seamless motion and immersive sensory elements that make every twist and turn feel impossibly real.


 The adventure doesn&rsquo;t end when the ride does. Expedition Odyssey seamlessly transitions guests into a real-world encounter with live Arctic animals, including beluga whales and walruses.


 This new indoor attraction will offer guests a unique new adventure at SeaWorl
