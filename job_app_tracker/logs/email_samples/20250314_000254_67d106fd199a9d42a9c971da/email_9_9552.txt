 Our world is about to change forever. 

 Why? 

 Senator Cynthia Loomis has introduced a bill that would – if passed – back 
the dollar with an asset few believed in only a few years ago.

 Even today, it makes up just 3 percent of the world’s total asset base. 

 But if the Trump White House has its way (and I think it will) I expect $15 
trillion to rotate out of stocks, gold,..

 Even out of real estate and into a new backing for the United States Dollar. 

 When we look back, I’m convinced what we’ll ultimately call the White House’s 
next move:

 ‘The Trump Shock.’ 

 To explain why, I’m rushing to release a brand-new, never-before-seen 
presentation. In it, I explain everything you need to know about what could 
ultimately become the greatest rotation of wealth in history.

 If you can understand what’s happening and decide to prepare today, you’ll be 
far ahead of 98% of Americans.

 If you choose to ignore the evidence I’ve found, you could be left behind.

P.S. I’ve worked with some of the world’s most respected funds. 

 I’ve also traded currencies for some of the highest-net-worth clients in 
America.

 My firm Atlas Research, for example, managed a multimillion-dollar account 
for a group of wealthy foreign nationals.

 I’ve traded and advised some of the biggest investors and institutions in the 
world.

 The list includes executives from trillion-dollar banks… names like Credit 
Suisse and others…

 And I’m telling them the same thing I’ll tell you in my urgent briefing: 

 Prepare NOW
