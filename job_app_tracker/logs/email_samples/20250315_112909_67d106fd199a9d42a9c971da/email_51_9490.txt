My Amazon FBA program (https://www.thepassionproductformula.com/?utm_source=Effective+Ecommerce&utm_campaign=edf3205904-March+Email+31_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_-ee4bbd28b6-107569198) will be opening up in 7 days - March 19th!

This is the last time I will have it open to the public.

After the program opens and closes for a week…

Or once the 20 spots available get taken…

The program will be removed from the internet forever.

I’m not kidding, either.

I’m changing some things around with my business…

And I’ll no longer be publicly promoting my Amazon FBA program after the next few weeks.

So if you want to get your hands on the resources that have helped me and thousands of everyday people make passive income on Amazon over the past 6 years…

Now is your last chance to join my Amazon FBA program. (https://www.thepassionproductformula.com/?utm_source=Effective+Ecommerce&utm_campaign=edf3205904-March+Email+31_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_-ee4bbd28b6-107569198)

This program?

It’s exactly what my student AJ went through to go from a bartender making minimum wage…

To an Amazon seller collecting $100k monthly paychecks from selling his product on Amazon

This program is what my student Brent used to go from a first responder pilot who never had any free time to spend with his kids…

To making about $1M selling his product on Amazon.

Which as a result?

Allowed him to replace his 9-5 job, make a remote income from anywhere in the world, and spend as much time as he wants with his kids.

My Amazon FBA program is even what my student Calvin used to replace his corporate engineering job…

With a passive income Amazon store paying him 300k+/yr
