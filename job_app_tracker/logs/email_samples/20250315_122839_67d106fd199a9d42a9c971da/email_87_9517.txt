Every day when I open X, I see it.

Some guy just built an app in 3 days.

Another dude launched an AI tool and got 1,000 users overnight.

Someone else went from idea → revenue in a WEEK.

It’s wild.

When I started Starter Story in 2017, it took me FOREVER to build the damn thing.

I spent weeks tweaking fonts, picking colors, and making sure everything was perfect.

I wasted SO much time coding from scratch. 

If I were starting over today?

I’d launch in a week. Maybe less.

AI has changed the game.

- You no longer need to be an engineer.
- You don’t need years of coding experience.
- You don’t even need to hire a developer.
With the right approach, AI can build your product for you.

The only question is: what are you gonna do with this opportunity?

This week I’m launching the first AI Build Accelerator.
 
A framework and system to teach you exactly how to build and ship products using AI.

This is not some generic tutorial that teaches you how to build an app you’ll never use.

This is a two-week sprint where you’ll actually build something real.

You’ll learn how to:

- Use AI tools like Lovable to go from idea → working app.
- Build fast and ship faster so you don’t waste months tweaking buttons.
- Get users on your product (because launching means nothing without attention).
And in two weeks, you’ll walk away with:

→ A working product.
→ A clear framework for building with AI.
→ The confidence to do it again and again.
