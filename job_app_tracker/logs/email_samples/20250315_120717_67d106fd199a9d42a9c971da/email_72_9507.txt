Stability in uncertain markets 


 <https://fundrise.com/investor-update/1236/view> 


A slew of new policies are driving increased market volatility and fears about 
a potential slowdown are now on the rise. In this environment, real estate 
continues to become an increasingly attractive tool for investors seeking 
greater stability and a way to derisk their portfolios. 
In fact, many of the factors driving down stock markets have the potential to 
drive up real estate values (lower rates and higher costs of construction being 
just two examples). 
With the stock market still at all time highs, and real estate still at 
relative lows, investors who continue to maintain or increase their exposure to 
private real estate have the potential to outperform those who do not. 
As our funds continue to execute on their investment strategies, we're seeing 
compelling performance across the portfolio, with meaningful milestones being 
achieved in both our growth and income-oriented offerings.

Flagship Fund: More properties achieving stabilization 
Two more communities in our Flagship Fund have successfully achieved 
stabilization (typically defined as the point at which a property achieves an 
occupancy rate of approximately 90-95%). This is an important milestone as it 
not only signals a significant reduction in the risk-profile of the asset but 
also typically coincides with increased positive cash-flow and more stable 
returns. These two communities add to the growing number of assets within the 
Flagship Fund that have successfully transitioned from the development stage to 
the income-generating stage.
