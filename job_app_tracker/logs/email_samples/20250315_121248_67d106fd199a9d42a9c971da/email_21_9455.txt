Hi Naeim,

Thanks for your interest in Pinterest! We know there are a lot of opportunities elsewhere and we’re grateful that you’re considering Pinterest and that you took the time to submit an application.

What happens now? We’ll review all applications and update you on the status of your application the second week of April. We’ll share more information about the program timeline and next steps for the process then.

Thanks again,

The Pinterest Recruiting Team
