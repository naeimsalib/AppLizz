I won’t sugarcoat it. The market has been brutal the last couple
weeks.

Just this Monday, the Nasdaq has dropped over 4%, the Dow
plunged more than 900 points, and panic is setting in for just
about everyone.

But here’s what history tells us: uncertainty often creates the
best investment opportunities. The challenge is knowing where to
look and who to trust for guidance.

The last time the market dropped significantly was in October
2022, when the S&P 500 fell 27% from its January highs. Just one
month later, we recommended two stocks, Cloudflare and Amazon.

Both went on to return over 100% to date.

For more than 25 years, we’ve helped investors navigate moments
like these—delivering a historical average return of
799%**, nearly 5x better than the
S&P 500’s 162%**.

Because we know how important expert guidance is in times like
these, we received special permission to offer a deeply
discounted rate… but only for today.
