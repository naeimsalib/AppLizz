** The Best Tips
------------------------------------------------------------

Hey there,

I know that many people have issues with their sources of income.

Why have one source if you plan to build enough wealth?

I had an afternoon away and thought about writing up some benefits of having multiple sources of income.

Here are some benefits:

1.Having more than one source of income, or extra income, offers a safety net. If one income source disappears, the others will still be there to lessen the blow.


2.Having extra income gives individuals time to reorganize and consider their options. Everyone alive today can appreciate the benefits of having an extra income.


3. Wealthy people have always known that it is important to have more than one source of income. If one of their income sources fails for some reason, they always have fallback sources to carry them through.


There are two types of extra incomes. Linear income is extra income that is earned on an hourly, weekly, or monthly basis. No future commitment from either the worker or the employer is associated with this kind of income. Residual income is income that results from working hard one time and reaping the benefits of this work for many years into the future. A single effort is rewarded repeatedly.

The Internet provides many options for extra income, but individuals must be careful when making a choice. There are many scams and get-rich-quick schemes online that are not legitimate residual income streams. This is why you need to make sure you are connected to the right source for your information.
