What you need to do



Deposit or transfer enough money to your account to establish and maintain a positive available balance if needed. 
Please ensure you have enough money in your account so that your available balance1 covers any recent or upcoming account activity.
If a transaction is returned for non-sufficient funds there is no fee; however, it's still important to make sure your available balance is increased enough to cover the transaction as these items may be resubmitted for payment by the payee.
Please review any recent or upcoming account activity and any pending or additional transactions that haven't been deducted from your available balance1. If these transactions reduce your available balance as of 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time during your Extra Day Grace Period, you'll need to add enough money to cover those as well.
If your available balance isn’t enough to cover all of these transactions by midnight Eastern Time, we'll cover as many as we can in the order they are listed. Any items with a fee showing as "pending" that are not covered as of 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time will be assessed a $35 overdraft fee during our nightly processing up to a maximum of three fees (or up to a maximum of two $15 overdraft fees for Teen Checking accounts).
