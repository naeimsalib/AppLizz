                <p>Hello NAEIM,</p>
                <p>
                	There is currently no payment due on your loan(s) at this time.
                    We want to keep you informed on the amount of outstanding interest on your loan(s), which may capitalize in accordance with your agreement.
                    If you choose to make payments during this time when payments are not required,
                    it will reduce the amount of interest added to your principal loan balance at repayment (capitalization).
                </p>
                <p>
