The Future of Tech is Taking Shape


Hi Naeim,

No one can predict the future, but tech trends give us a strong idea of where we’re headed.

According to [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2022/06/28/as-ai-advances-will-human-workers-disappear/?cid=eml-ry0rwd&ch=ML), AI is expected to create 12 million more jobs than it will replace. Additionally, [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/software/ai-in-business/?cid=eml-ry0rwd&ch=ML) notes that businesses are already moving toward AI implementation in key areas, including:

- 56% are using AI to improve and perfect business operations
