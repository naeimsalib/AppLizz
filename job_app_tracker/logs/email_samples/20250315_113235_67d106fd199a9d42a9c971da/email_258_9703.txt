Hello,

 

Is your puppy giving you the cold shoulder when you call their name or
ask them to do something? 🐶 It can feel frustrating, but the truth
is—puppies don’t ignore us on purpose. They just need the right
training to understand what we’re asking for!

 

In my latest YouTube video, “PUPPY TRAINING: WHAT TO DO WHEN YOUR
PUPPY WON’T LISTEN
[https://dreamdogtraining.krtra.com/c/sSHE980dWTXc/x1ved],”
I’ll share:
✅ Why your puppy might not be listening
✅ Easy training tips to get their attention
✅ How to build focus and communication with positive techniques

 

Teaching your puppy to listen doesn’t have to be hard—with
patience, practice, and the right approach, your pup will be paying
attention in no time!
