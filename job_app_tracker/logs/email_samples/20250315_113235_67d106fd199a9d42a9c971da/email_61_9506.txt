 As you read this, your humble narrator will be at the HumanX conference 
talking to leaders in the world of AI. Whether we like it or not, AI is 
becoming a key part of the technological landscape. This week, we feature two 
conversations with people building real AI solutions: optimizing models for 
edge devices and using specialty models for translation and beyond.

We do have other non-AI material for you. The podcast welcomed a blog 
contributor for a conversation on secure coding, what it takes to secure a 
Canadian election, and the legal ramifications of being a lousy CISO. Plus, our 
Teams product has shiny new features and we're excited to tell you about them.

Never fear my intrepid knowledge explorers, there are plenty of goodies from 
the Stack Exchange network and beyond! Is the Earth dodging the Moon? Can you 
learn HTML and CSS from a game? Can a catch-all email domain be abused by bad 
actors? Can SQLite be abused to handle concurrency? And more.
