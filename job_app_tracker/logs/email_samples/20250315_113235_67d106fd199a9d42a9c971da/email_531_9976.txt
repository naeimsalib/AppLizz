Who else feels singled out by HOA I have been here since 2017 and they have
and abnormal liking to my house and I look around and I see my neighbors
houses and on other blocks worse than mine I get violations after violations
when I fix one thing

house I did the violation for the paint buckets on the side of the house from
when I was painting I was Landscaping and a violation for the rocks on the
side of the house I was fixing the garage cause the ceiling came down and
violation for the sheet rock the gave me a violation for a pooper scooper that
I left for five minutes before  came back to get it how can I show that Iâ€™m
being harassed
