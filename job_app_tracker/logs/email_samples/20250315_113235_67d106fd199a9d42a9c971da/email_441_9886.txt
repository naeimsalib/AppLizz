But here&rsquo;s where it gets interesting&hellip;


While Canada scrambles, Trump&rsquo;s tariffs are protecting smart investors &mdash; and there&rsquo;s one company perfectly positioned to win big.


Mode Mobile is 100% American-made, meaning:

>No foreign supply chain risks
>No price hikes from tariffs
> No dependency on Canada, China, Mexico, or Europe


When tariffs hit, companies relying on imports get crushed &mdash; but Mode Mobile keeps winning.
