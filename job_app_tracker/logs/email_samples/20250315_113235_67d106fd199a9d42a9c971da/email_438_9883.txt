PLUS: Last chance for certification discount

Hey there! Welcome to Platform Weekly. Our weekly turn of the platform engineering Rubik's cube. Things are moving faster than ever before. It‚Äôs incredible what is happening, and I can‚Äôt wait to discuss it.

It‚Äôs your last chance to join the platform engineering certification course  (https://cJq2d04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/LX+113/cJq2d04/VVNvll4_gPHCW32-gL24M3t0FW8tMMP_5t7LL8N3JhCGH3pyd0W7Y8-PT6lZ3lxN14RZ2jR6cV5N157Q_6Vd0Q5W34bl9Y2BN8bnN4vSwqHhYDK2W62vSgj1QslqqW1Y--vy5sdmmRV-0Gsc4sjdgfW613KsZ1pb-ddN7BxJ6GntF44W6FQ1J09871Y2N8pHzZc3vDwbW1jQJv28t6S0MW94-zgt7t9QJGVsQfS98wPb5RVM-3l48CHDZtW82y30t51B7cCW7ZWq8q1xfn0XW5jFJCG8x3jz_W3bF8kk7sNsCGV897cw6ZC39mW2nJkKC12DsXhW2NYbWG57LQNdVWDxCJ5ZT0YXW8ndXp51ypsv4W65PY4j27F39LV11sSb8ZVPcVf6Wq1R404 ) starting on March 20th next week.

DAPR, AI & Deutschland

Last night, we had our second ever in-person platform engineering roundtable in Germany. If you‚Äôve never been to one of our roundtables. You need to.

It‚Äôs a small collection of platform engineering nerds (like me) sitting around and discussing their experience and thoughts on platform engineering.

Sometimes it‚Äôs a few leaders sharing war stories in a tiny, cramped room. Sometimes like last night (thanks to codecentric AG who helped us organise it), it's an awesome venue, with great food, and dozens of experts of every walk of life - 20 year veterans, first time platform engineers, consultancy CEOs, and more debating every intricacy of platform engineering for hours.

So, what did 40 platform engineering leaders have to say in Munich last night?

- AI platform engineering is coming here. From code, and infra generation to AI-enabled infra orchestration. It‚Äôs clear AI is going to be a huge part of PE. But it‚Äôs also clear - that a lot of it just ain‚Äôt enterprise ready yet *cough TF file generation *cough.
