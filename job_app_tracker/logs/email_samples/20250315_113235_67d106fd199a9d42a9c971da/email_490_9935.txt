Hi Naeim,

This is Aileen, one of the representatives from Possible. Thank you for letting us know about that, no worries, I'd be happy to help you with that!

It looks like you have a payment that has already begun processing through your checking account ending in 1775. I'm happy to help update your payment method for use on future payments, but the update isn't able to be applied to the processing payment. I apologize for the inconvenience!

We require notice at least 2 business days in advance if you would like to make any updates to your payments. However, once a payment begins processing we aren't able to redirect it to process through a different method.

No worries, I can see here that your Goldman Sachs Bank account ending in 8680 has been manually added to your account.

I have sent you a request in the app to confirm authorization for Possible to initiate automatic payments from this account.

**Once you have completed this request, your account ending in 8680 will be your default payment method for this loan, and you will see “AutoPay” listed next to it.**

We have only updated your payment account, not your primary account. When you take out a new loan, your primary account will become your default payment method unless you request this to be changed.

Please note that the previous account will still show in the app since we had it linked before.

Best,
Aileen‍ from Possible
