** Setting Your Income For The New Month
------------------------------------------------------------

Gosh, time flies. The month February is over, and March is here. Another month has come and gone!  And I really appreciate your support!

It’s the time  again for some much-needed reflection and introspection to set  the right tone for the new month!

I wanted to share the biggest goals for the month  with you.

The first goal  is to help my clients increase their income .


Yes, I really want to focus my energy on helping my clients increase their income this year and some ways i will teach them include:
*  Holding a yard sale or boot fair to sell objects or clutter around your house which you are not using can increase your income.
* Think about starting a small business. It does not have to be a big business but with a lot of hard work and focus on long term goals then it is possible to establish.

The second goal  is to help clients have an effective budget, planning system working in their life.

A budget is an organized managed system which tells you exactly how much you have coming in and going out over a period of time. There are several types of budget systems which can be used.

The third goal is to help clients discover what they are passionate about.


First of all, write the idea down on paper. Then work to expand the idea as soon as possible, while it is fresh in your mind. Continue creating the idea until it becomes reality. Seek advice and help from people who can help you. It could provide you more income.

This year, choose to be financially free, let me guide you on the path to financial freedom.
