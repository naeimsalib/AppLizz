Naeim -

You might've heard, but a few weeks ago Amazon announced
something pretty big...

Amazon just announced their New Seller Incentives program and
this is a massive bonus for anyone thinking about starting
Private Label in 2025.

They're kicking back a % of your initial sales when you start
selling:

* 10% cash back on your first $50,000 in sales
* 5% cash back on your first $1 million in sales

Let that sink in for a second...

Amazon is giving away money to new sellers who launch on their
platform because they need more sellers.

If that doesn't completely destroy the "Amazon is oversaturated"
myth, I don't know what will.

Think about it - would Amazon be incentivizing NEW sellers if it
was saturated?

Of course not.

The truth is that Amazon's marketplace continues to expand at a
ridiculous pace. More buyers are shopping on Amazon than ever
before, which means they desperately need more sellers (like you)
to keep up with demand.

This is exactly why I've been telling you that Amazon FBA is the
perfect side hustle right now if you want to:

* Start with reasonable capital ($5-10k)
* Build something that doesn't consume your life
* Create consistent monthly income that can replace your 9-5

These new seller incentives are basically Amazon's way of saying
"we want YOU on our platform" - and they're willing to pay for
it.

I've broken down exactly how to take advantage of these
incentives in our latest free training. (
