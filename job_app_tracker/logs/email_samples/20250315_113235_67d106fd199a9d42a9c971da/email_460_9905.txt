Hey Naeim,

Here's the exact strategy that we used to take our client from 100 visitors / month to over 25,000 visitors per month. (Making them an extra $300k / year btw!)

1. Do a 

**keyword gap analysis** with your top 3 competitors

2. Find 

**easy keywords** to rank for

3. 

**Create content outlines** using the heading tags from the top 3 search results for each keyword (and adding in secondary keywords from our research)

4. 

**Ask ChatGPT**to write a post based on that outline

5. 

**Edit that post** to include personal details, stories, and experience.

6. Do this 

**twice per week** for 6 - 12 months

**7. Watch your traffic grow. **

&#128680; Most business owners never stick to this long enough to see results.
