Every time a new tech wave hits, people start asking the same question:

“Did I miss my chance?”

I saw a tweet the other day:

“AI is already saturated. The best time to start was last year.”

LMAO.
 
You think we’re too late?

This is like saying it was too late to start a YouTube channel in 2015. Or too late to start a blog in 2010.

The biggest AI businesses haven’t even been built yet.

We’re still in the early days!!

And here’s the best part:

For the first time ever, you don’t need to be a developer to build a product.

AI coding tools are making it so that anyone can build an app.

In a few hours. With a few prompts.

I see people every day launching products insanely fast.
 
Stuff that used to take months of coding is now getting built in a weekend.

But while most people sit around waiting for “the perfect idea” or wondering if it’s too late…

The real builders are already launching.

Are you going to be one of them?

On Monday, we begin the very first AI Build Accelerator. 

It’s a 2-week sprint where we teach you how to use AI coding tools to build a working app—without writing a single line of code.

Imagine this: in 12 days, you can go from idea → actual product.

And you’ll do it alongside a group of builders all pushing each other forward.

The doors to this close soon.

If you’ve been sitting on an idea, now’s the time.
